## The Beginning

I met Vishnu in 2016, when I was in my first year of college. I am really bad at CPP programming and got a low grade, but I saw someone getting the highest mark in the class and he was sitting in the somewhere in the front bench. This is where it all started,'can you teach me cpp concepts one hour per day for like a week'. I kept going each week to learn cpp to him and I came to know he is seriously good in other subjects too, so I started studying with him. This is the only combined studies I have done in my whole life that yeilded good result.

## The Bad Times
Things went really rough in second year for some reason, I got my grade and I was depressed for multiple reasons during that time. It was Vishnu who was there all the time encouraging me to do better. I became a 2 year old kid, where a teacher have to hold your hand to make you write something. Vishnu was the teacher who held my hand and made things done. Even with a lot of effort from his end the grades couldnt improve though. That because something else is running on top of the head. I was not able to focus on studies. My CG dropped from 8.3 to 7.1, which is extremly bad. I have worked so hard to make it 8 and lost it. 

This is where things have gone beyond, One day I have to wake up with the news Vishnu's father is no more, which contributed more for the existing depression I had. He have to leave me and go to his home town to take care of his family. Vishnu was back and then one more I got to got a few health issues and got to go home. Things got worsend and I had to redo an year. Thus I thought it will be an end for our friendship since we got separated for a year. 

## The Good Times

I had come back to college to study the third year one more time. Yes, you guessed it right, I have to study the same subjects again. After combating the health issues, depression and shit didnt seem a big deal. We are back on track and started studying hard. Vishnu was there again to help and guide me up. It went well as planned. I have got consecutive 8.5,9,9,8.5 for the followin g semesters, and my CG went back to 8.0 again.

We never planned to go for a trip, but always wanted to publish a paper in our college days. Fortunatly this was one of the best trips I had in my life. We got a chance to go Kerala.

Because of the COVID, we have to split again and then move in seperate place for our Jobs. I choosed to be research domain and was in Chennai and he lived in Banglore. God has to think that you need to meet him, only then in someway you go to temple. I have to go to Banglore in the same way.

## Things I learned from Vishnu
Its been almost 6 years I met vishnu and here are the things I learned from him.
1. Be a good friend and expect nothing back. Friendship is not a business deal you make. Its a bond you share with someone.
2. Have a God(some supereme power you believe in) and pray to it. Doesnt matter with whom you pray(religion or methodology). Just pray. The only reason to do this is to have a peace of mind and stay positive since your are trying to gets things accomplished without hurting anyone.
3. Bigger Heart >>>>> Bigger Brain. The reason to stay with him for a very long time he has good intension inside the heart and this is the reason he is a happy person.
4. <em>You neednot have luxuries in life to be a happy person, fancy english or posh clothes doesnt make you superior in the room. It doesnt make you happy either.</em>
5. Plan things in the correct way, and connect the dots in a proper manner. Things go upside down, but be stable and dont lose your cool. You will be able to get things done.
6. <em>You never need a therapist, you need someone to open up to. You need someone to talk to. You need someone to listen to you. You need someone to be there for you. You need someone to be your friend. Get a friend and be a friend like that.</em>
