Deep Sea creatures always facinated me. I think there is more to explore in the ocean rather than in the space. Somehow I feel we can crack the code for the begining of life on earth from the deep sea rather space explorations. 

The deep sea creatures have evolved in the absence of sunlight. I am not sure how they do that, so my journey begins here.

I will be blogging about deep sea creatures and their evolution. If facinated take ride with me in the following blogs.
