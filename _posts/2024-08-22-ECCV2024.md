### Insights on Academic and Research Success

**Focus on Quality over Quantity**  
Aim to write impactful, high-quality papers, following the example of researchers like Kaiming He, rather than producing a high volume of low-impact work.

**Future-Forward Problem Statements**  
Select research problems that are ahead of their time, focusing on areas that the industry is unlikely to tackle in the next 5 years. This ensures your work remains relevant and groundbreaking.

**Iterative Adaptation in Research**  
Approach research topics like developing a taste for coffeeâ€”initially challenging, but over time, youâ€™ll adapt to a particular flavor or niche that resonates with you.

**Deep Expertise in a Single Area**  
Develop deep expertise in one domain rather than spreading efforts thinly across multiple topics. Specialization often yields greater recognition and deeper contributions.

**Fundamental Innovations Over Trends**  
Focus on addressing fundamental challenges rather than following hyped topics. Unique, foundational contributions often yield long-term impact and recognition.

**Admission Processes**  
Understand that professors may not have complete autonomy in selecting students; initial screenings and decisions are often made at the university level based on set criteria.

**Conferences as Networking Hubs**  
Attending conferences like ECCV not only helps in sharing your work but also offers opportunities to network with leading researchers, identify trending topics, and gather feedback to refine your research direction.

**Industry-Academia Divide**  
Recognize that academia allows freedom to explore novel, uncharted problems, while industry research may focus on immediate applications and profitability. Use this distinction to define your academic contributions.

**Patience in Research Journey**  
Breakthroughs often take time. Commit to your research journey with patience, persistence, and adaptability, as impactful results may not come immediately.

**Holistic Approach to Research**  
Complement technical rigor with effective communication skills, presentation abilities, and interdisciplinary knowledge to stand out in a competitive field.

**Impact Beyond Publications**  
Strive for research that not only results in publications but also drives real-world applications or inspires subsequent research.

**Stay Updated, Stay Relevant**  
Continuously keep yourself informed about advancements in your chosen field and adjacent domains. This ensures your work remains relevant and innovative.

**Collaboration is Key**  
Collaborate with peers, industry professionals, and interdisciplinary teams to broaden perspectives and enhance the scope of your research.

### What to Do at a Conference

**Prepare by Reviewing Papers**  
Prior to attending, obtain the list of presented papers and review their work in advance. This preparation helps you identify specific researchers or sessions of interest, allowing you to ask insightful questions in person. Avoid going in unprepared, as the abundance of information can be overwhelming and lead to quick saturation. You will have a whole block where all the papers will be related to 3d, 2d, diffusion models, federated learning....etc.

**Build a Strong Network**  
Make as many connections as possible. Take photos of attendee ID cards to help you remember individuals and later connect with them. Engage in conversations to learn more about their research and foster potential collaborations. I had a chance to talk with our professor academic cousins professors and their students.

**Attend Workshops Strategically**  
Workshops often provide a condensed overview of state-of-the-art techniques and ideas within an hour. Attending these sessions allows you to absorb key advancements efficiently. Since I am more of 2d vision guy, I would be interested in 3d vision and sovling 3d problems in 2d. 

**Participate in Poster Sessions**  
Poster sessions are excellent for one-on-one interactions with researchers. Use this opportunity to delve deeper into their work, discuss methodologies, and explore potential applications of their research. 

**Engage in Q&A Sessions**  
Ask questions during presentations to clarify concepts, challenge ideas, or spark discussions. This not only helps you understand the work better but also establishes you as an engaged participant.

**Take Detailed Notes**  
Keep a notebook or digital device handy to jot down key takeaways, interesting ideas, or potential future research directions. Notes will help you revisit and reflect on what youâ€™ve learned after the conference. 

**Exchange Ideas**  
Share your work with peers to get feedback and suggestions. Conversations about your research can lead to new insights or even collaborations.

**Follow Up Post-Conference**  
After the conference, reach out to the people you met. This follow-up helps solidify connections and keeps the conversation alive for potential collaborations or mentorship. This is where I make most of the connection the last day is there just for that, tell hello to as many people as you can. 

**Explore Industry Stalls**  
If the conference includes industry exhibits, visit booths to learn about the latest tools, datasets, or collaborations that could enhance your research. To ask people for referral or problems that they are trying solve.

**Plan Breaks and Downtime**  
Conferences can be intense, so schedule short breaks to rest and process information. Use this time to review notes, organize contacts, or prepare for upcoming sessions.

**Attend Keynotes and Plenaries**  
Keynote speeches often provide a broad perspective on current trends and future directions in the field. Make it a priority to attend these sessions.
