In this journey we will be moving towards setting up a path for generative AI using custom datasets and experiments with tools we learned in deep learning series.

In deep learning series we got to know how to do experimentations and how to setup a project. We will be using the same tools and techniques to setup a project for generative AI. From there we setup to do things in a way that we can experiment with different models and datasets.
