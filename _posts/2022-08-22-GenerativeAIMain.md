In this journey we will be moving towards setting up a path for generative AI using custom datasets and experiments with tools we learned in deep learning series.

In deep learning series we got to know how to do experimentations and how to setup a project. We will be using the same tools and techniques to setup a project for generative AI. From there we setup to do things in a way that we can experiment with different models and datasets.

In the world of generative AI, we always look for dimension reduction, bring a whole big image to meaningfull vectors called embeddings. Its all about embeddings in the end. These embedding tells about the image and we can use these embeddings to generate new images. We can also use these embeddings to do image search, image classification, image detection, image captioning...etc.

So the ultimate focus will be on embeddings and how to generate new images from embeddings. We will be using different models to generate new images from embeddings. We will be using VAE, GAN's, Diffusion models...etc.

We will be exploring transformer and convolutional architectures to generate embeddings. Use the conv or transfomer blcoks to build different UNET and VAE architectures.

From the various architectures we will be using, we will be using the best one to generate embeddings and then we will be using the best model to generate new images from embeddings.
