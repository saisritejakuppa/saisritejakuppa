<h1>
Life at HTIC
</h1>

HTIC is a healthcare research lab inside IIT Research park. I have joined Team SSR(spine surgical robotics) as a final-year intern. I have worked for almost a year and a half over here as a robotic engineer. The lab is run by professor Dr. Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam. When I go to the lab, I see a lot of unique minds wanting to do something different. 


<h1>
My Journey into HTIC
</h1>


It all started with applying for machine learning position for a robotic company. I know sounds wierd but that's how it started. I was working on a project for my final year in this company.


I was working all the time, under the guidance of an MS Scholar named Shyam A. The perk I got working in the team is the flexibility to learn something new in the first couple of months. I always had a soft corner for healthcare applications and products. So I was working on Sundays, back in those days. During the first couple of months, I got to learn about working in ROS and packages along with it(MoveIt, FastIK, RViz). This is like full-time things, which is so exciting to see you working robotics in simulation and stuff. 

The perk of being in the office and working is you can start moving with the real robot. I have personally worked with 4 different robots, namely, Elfin, UR, KUKA, and Staubli. I have worked with both Cobot and Industrial robots. The company has enough funds to bring in and spend on new robots, It doesn't purchase all of them, but the company rents them. Yet a few robots, the company owns it.

So after working with robots for 6 months, I started digging into the application part. I was given the task to design the motion planning of the robot for spine surgical application. We already have a motion planning code, but we wanted it to be fast and the code to be feasible to adopt for more robots.
