This series of blog will help you to learn 
1. How to setup a project.
2. How to experiment with the project.

I will be using python and pytorch for this series of blog. For experimentation part, I will be working with wandb, which is a great tool to experiment with your project. We will not do just a simple projects on the ways we will be working on that includes classifications, detections, VAE, GAN's, Diffusion models...etc. 

Since I have some exprience in deep learning and working with images. We will be sticking to image datasets alone and sometime later I will be including NLP as well.
