We begin with electric fishes and how does it generate the electricty.

As we go deeper and deeper into the sea, the light diminishes out, one of the way to communicate with other fishes is electricty. Electric eels are the fishes that generate electricty. They generate electricty by using their muscles. They have a special organ called electrocytes. These electrocytes are filled with salt water. When the muscles contract, the salt water is pushed out of the electrocytes. This salt water is filled with ions. When the ions are pushed out, they create a charge. This charge is what we call electricty. The electric eels can generate electricty upto 600 volts. This electricty is used to stun their prey and to communicate with other fishes.

Weakly electric and strong electric are 2 fishes that generate electricty. Weakly electric fishes generate electricty upto 100 volts. Strong electric fishes generate electricty upto 600 volts. Electric eels are strong electric fishes. They generate electricty upto 600 volts. Strong one can incapacitate a fish and immobilize it. Weak one use the electric to check the distance between the fish, check its dead/alive and to communicate with other fishes.

Strong Electric Fishes:
1. Electric Eels.
2. Electric Rays.
3. Electric Catfish.
