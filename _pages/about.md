Hey there, Myself Sai Sri Teja, I am currently working as a deep learning engineer in Detect Technologies, IIT-Madras Research Park. 

When not immersed in the latest developments in AI research, you can find me enjoying a cup of coffee on a sunny beach, or pushing themselves to the limit by running marathons. With a passion for combining innovation and real-world application, I am always looking for new ways to explore the intersection of science and industry.

Whether they're working on the next breakthrough in technology or shredding on their guitar, I am individual with a thirst for knowledge and a passion for living life to the fullest.

If you are intrested to chat anything about Deep Learning, Neuroscience, Cats, Beaches, Maths or wanna go for clubbing, ping me at kuppasaisriteja@gmail.com.
